# EMM
The aim of the library is to facilitate the seamless use of EMM with common Python data science libraries such as ```pandas``` and ```scikit-learn```. The process of generating synthetic data with EMM is divided into four parts: pre-processing, finding the optimal weights, construction of the synthetic dataset, and evaluating metrics.
